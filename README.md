# GriftlandsExpanded

Mod for Griftlands that expands the game by adding new cards and bosses. In the future, I would like to add some new enemies and grafts as well.

## Currently Added

19 battle and 8 negotiation cards for Sal

13 battle and 8 negotiation cards for Rook

3 new bosses for Sal's story

2 new boss for Rook's story

Item rewards for killing the new bosses

Generous amount of typos and inconsistent formatting

## Installation Guide

Official guide [here](https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/116914-early-mod-support/).

0. Delete old version of the mod first

1. Go to "[user]/AppData/Roaming/Klei/Griftlands/" (it should contain save folder, log.txt and other game-generated files)
2. Open the folder consisting of alphanumeric characters (it looks something like this: "72619hh2dd464m811a1b0e3a6ed")
3. Create a new folder called "mods"
4. Unzip "GriftlandsExpanded-master" folder into "mods" folder
5. Start a new run and have fun

If it doesn't work, put the "mods" folder directly into "[user]/AppData/Roaming/Klei/Griftlands/"

## Compatibility

Intended and tested for the main game version. Use it with the experimental branch at your own risk.

I can't guarantee complete compatibility with other mods, but feel free to try.

## Feedback and Troubleshooting

If you want to report bugs, complain about balance, or give any other kind of feedback please direct it [here](https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/118889-custom-bosses-and-cards/).

Please, keep in mind that this is a mod and so it can't be perfectly balanced.

## What's next?

I have no clue. I gave up on trying to organize my work and now I just do whatever I feel like doing. Deal with it.
